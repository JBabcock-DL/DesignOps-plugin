# Detroit Labs DesignOps Plugin

A Claude Code plugin that gives Detroit Labs designers seven skill-based commands for automating Figma design operations — scaffolding projects, building design systems, syncing tokens, adding components, linking code, localizing screens, and running accessibility audits.

All skill logic lives in `SKILL.md` instruction files. There is no TypeScript code, no bundler, and no install script. Everything runs through the Claude Code agent using the Figma MCP connector for authentication.

## How It Works

Each skill is an instruction file (`SKILL.md`) that tells the Claude Code agent exactly how to perform a design ops task. When you invoke a skill, Claude reads the instructions and executes the steps using:

- **Figma MCP connector** — all Figma file creation, canvas writes (pages, frames, variables, components), Code Connect, and read operations
- **Figma REST API** — variable write-back for `/create-design-system` and `/sync-design-system`
- **Filesystem access** — reading and writing local token files (`tokens.css`, `tokens.json`, `tailwind.config.js`) for sync and component wiring
- **Claude's built-in capabilities** — inline translation for localization, WCAG contrast calculations for accessibility

Skills pass context to each other through `templates/agent-handoff.md`, so you can chain `/new-project` → `/create-design-system` → `/create-component` → `/code-connect` without losing your place.

---

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Notes |
|---|---|
| **Claude Code** | CLI or desktop app — this is a Claude Code plugin, not a Figma plugin |
| **Figma MCP connector** | Must be active in Claude Code (Settings → MCP → Figma). Handles all Figma authentication — no personal access token needed for `/new-project` |
| **Organization-tier Figma account** | Required for the Variables REST API (write) used by `/create-design-system` and `/sync-design-system` |
| **Node.js** (for `/create-component`) | Required to run `npx shadcn@latest add` locally |

---

## Installation

1. Clone this repository into your Claude Code plugins directory:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/detroit-labs/DesignOps-plugin
   ```

2. In Claude Code, open **Settings → Plugins** and add the plugin from the cloned directory. Claude Code reads `plugin.json` and registers all seven skills automatically.

3. Connect the Figma MCP connector in **Settings → MCP → Figma** and complete the OAuth flow with your organization Figma account.

4. Verify the setup by running `/new-project` — Claude will prompt for team name and project name if no arguments are provided.

## Skills

### /new-project

Create and scaffold a `<Project Name> — Foundations` design system file using the Figma MCP connector. The file is created in Drafts, the full page tree is created, **documentation canvas** is drawn (headers, table of contents, token overview skeleton, cover + file thumbnail), then a single move instruction is provided at the end.

**Syntax**
```
/new-project
/new-project --team "Team Name" --name "Project Name"
```

**What it creates**

| File | Target Folder | Method |
|---|---|---|
| `<Project Name> — Foundations` | `Design-Systems/` | Created via MCP `create_new_file`, pages and canvas via sequential `use_figma` calls |

The file lands in Drafts. At the end of the run Claude provides a one-step move instruction: right-click the file in Figma → Move to Project → Design-Systems/.

**Scaffold sequence (see `skills/new-project/SKILL.md`)**

| Step | What happens |
|---|---|
| 5 | Rename first page, create all pages from the Detroit Labs hierarchy |
| 5b | Doc header (`_Header`) + dashed `_Content` region on **every page except `Thumbnail`** (cover is the meta surface for that page) |
| 5c | **Table of Contents** on `📝 Table of Contents` — two-column section cards; link rows named `toc-link/{exact Figma page name}` for automation |
| 5d | **Token Overview** skeleton on `↳ Token Overview` — architecture, mapping table, mode panels, binding tips, Claude commands; `placeholder/*` nodes cleared when `/create-design-system` runs |
| 5e | **Thumbnail** — full-bleed `Cover` (gradient, project title, chips, mark) and `setFileThumbnailNodeAsync` |
| 6–7 | Move instructions; optional chain to `/create-design-system` with `templates/agent-handoff.md` |

**Page hierarchy** — sourced from the Detroit Labs Foundations template and extended with shadcn/ui component pages, organized into atomic design groups:

- Token & Style Docs (Table of Contents, Token Overview, MCP Tokens)
- Style Guide (Primitives, Theme, Layout, Text Styles, Effects)
- Brand Assets (Logo Marks, Vector Patterns, Icons, Imagery, Motion)
- Atoms (Typography, Label, Kbd, Dividers, Avatar, Badge, Chips, Tags, Counters, Aspect Ratio)
- Buttons & Controls (Buttons, Button Group, Toggle, Toggle Group, Segmented Controller)
- Inputs & Forms (Text Field, Textarea, Input Group, Input OTP, Checkbox, Radio, Switch, Select, Combobox, Slider, Calendar, Date Picker, and more)
- Feedback & Status (Alerts, Toast, Sonner, Progress, Loaders, Skeleton, Blank states, Error States, and more)
- Overlays (Dialogue, Drawer, Sheets, Popover, Hover Card, Tooltips, Dropdown Menu, Command)
- Navigation (Top/Bottom/Tablet Nav, Sidebar, Menubar, Breadcrumb, Tabs bar, Pagination, and more)
- Data Display (Data Table, Lists, Chart, Stat block, Widgets, Video player)
- Content Containers (Cards, Tiles, Carousel, Accordion, Collapsible, Resizable, Scroll Area)
- Native & Platform (Native Device Parts)
- Utility (`Documentation components`, `Grids`, `parking lot`)

After creating and scaffolding the file, Claude offers to chain into `/create-design-system`.

**File naming convention:** All titles use an em dash (`—`) with a space on each side: `<Project Name> — <File Type>`

---

### /create-design-system

Initialize a design system in a Figma file by pushing brand tokens into five variable collections, and write a `tokens.css` file to the local codebase that `/create-component` uses to wire CSS custom properties into the project.

**Syntax**
```
/create-design-system
```

No platform argument — platform mapping (Web / Android / iOS) is encoded as `codeSyntax` on every variable rather than as separate alias collections.

**What it does**

1. Checks `templates/agent-handoff.md` for an active file key before prompting
2. Collects brand tokens interactively (primary, secondary, neutral, tertiary, and error colors; body and display font families; base font size, spacing unit, and border radius)
3. Generates the `Primitives` collection: five full color ramps (primary, secondary, tertiary, error, neutral — 50–950 stops via Tailwind HSL interpolation), `Space/*` spacing scale, `Corner/*` radius scale, elevation floats
4. Creates the `Theme` collection (Light / Dark modes): **54** semantic color aliases across **7** groups — `background/` (canvas + container ladder + fg + inverse + scrim/shadow; WEB `--color-background*`; ANDROID/iOS codeSyntax still uses M3 **surface** roles), `border/` (`default` / `subtle`; WEB `--color-border*`), `primary/`, `secondary/`, `tertiary/` (each includes standard + **fixed** roles), `status/` (error + fixed), and `component/` (shadcn: input, ring, sidebar) — all aliasing Primitives per mode
5. Creates the `Typography` collection (8 scale modes): 12 type style slots (Display, Headline, Body, Label — each in LG/MD/SM) × 4 properties (font-family, font-size, font-weight, line-height). Font sizes scale across 8 modes modeled on Android's font-scale curve: 85%, 100% (default), 110%, 120%, 130%, 150%, 175%, 200%. Large text uses nonlinear scaling (Android 14 behaviour) at high multipliers.
6. Creates the `Layout` collection (Default mode): `space/*` and `radius/*` semantic aliases into Primitives
7. Creates the `Effects` collection (Light / Dark modes): shadow color (opacity changes per mode) and blur aliases into elevation Primitives
8. Writes all five collections to Figma via the Variables REST API with `codeSyntax` (WEB/ANDROID/iOS) on every variable
9. Verifies the write with a GET call and reports final variable counts
10. **Writes `tokens.css`** to the local codebase — the CSS source of truth for the project (see [Token Architecture](#token-architecture))
11. Updates `templates/agent-handoff.md` with `token_css_path` so `/create-component` can locate the file automatically
12. **`use_figma` — Style guide** — redraws token visualization on `↳ Primitives`, `↳ Theme`, `↳ Layout`, `↳ Text Styles`, `↳ Effects` (content below the doc header; see skill for layout spec)
13. **`use_figma` — MCP Tokens** — builds `[MCP] Token Manifest` with JSON + tables for machine and human audit
14. **`use_figma` — Token Overview** — replaces skeleton data, updates swatches and tables from live variables, removes `placeholder/*` notes
15. **`use_figma` — Thumbnail** — updates `Cover` gradient stops from `color/primary/500` and `color/secondary/500`, re-applies file thumbnail

**Requires:** Organization-tier Figma account for the Variables REST API write endpoint.

---

### /sync-design-system

Diff a local token file against the current Figma variable state and push changes in either direction.

**Syntax**
```
/sync-design-system
/sync-design-system <figma-file-key>
/sync-design-system https://www.figma.com/design/<file-key>/...
```

**Arguments**

| Argument | Description |
|---|---|
| `file_key` | Figma file URL or bare key. Falls back to `agent-handoff.md` context, then prompts interactively. |

**Supported local token formats**

- `tokens.css` — CSS custom properties (`:root`, `[data-theme="dark"]`, `[data-font-scale="N"]`)
- `tokens.json` — W3C Design Token Community Group (DTCG) format
- `tailwind.config.js` — Tailwind CSS configuration

**What it does**

1. Reads the local token file from the filesystem and flattens it to a `collection/mode/token-name → value` map
2. Reads the current Figma variable state via the Variables REST API, flattening each mode separately (Theme: Light/Dark, Typography: all 8 scale modes, Effects: Light/Dark)
3. Computes a three-way diff: NEW (in code, not in Figma), MISSING (in Figma, not in code), CONFLICTS (different values)
4. Presents the diff and asks which action to take:
   - **Push to Figma** — write local token values to Figma variables, writing all required modes
   - **Push to code** — write Figma variable values back to the local token file
   - **Push both** — sync in both directions (only available when there are no conflicts)
   - **Review manually** — resolve each conflict one at a time before pushing
5. Flags any legacy `Web`, `Android/M3`, or `iOS/HIG` collections as deprecated if found
6. **After a successful push to Figma** (options 1, 3, or confirmed manual push): runs **`use_figma`** to **redraw affected style guide pages** so swatches match the new variable values, then **rebuilds the `[MCP] Token Manifest`** on `↳ MCP Tokens`. Skipped when only pushing to code (option 2).

---

### /create-component

Install one or more shadcn/ui components, wire them to the project's CSS token file, draw them onto the Figma canvas with token variable bindings, and offer to chain into Code Connect.

**Syntax**
```
/create-component button
/create-component button input card dialog
```

**Arguments**

| Argument | Description |
|---|---|
| `[components...]` | One or more shadcn/ui component names. Prompted interactively if omitted. |

**What it does**

1. Locates `tokens.css` from `agent-handoff.md` (`token_css_path`) or by searching the project
2. Initializes shadcn/ui if not already set up (`npx shadcn@latest init`)
3. **Wires `tokens.css` into the project's global CSS** — removes shadcn's generated `@layer base` variable block and adds `@import 'tokens.css'` so all shadcn components resolve their CSS custom properties from the design system (both files use the same variable names)
4. Installs each component via `npx shadcn@latest add <component>`
5. Draws the component structure on the Figma canvas, routing each component to its designated page in the Foundations scaffold
6. Binds Figma variable tokens from the `Theme`, `Layout`, and `Typography` collections to each canvas component
7. Offers to chain into `/code-connect`

Because `tokens.css` defines **canonical** Tailwind-friendly theme vars (`--color-background`, `--color-content`, `--color-border`, `--color-primary`, …) plus shadcn aliases (`--background` → `var(--color-background)`, `--foreground` → `var(--color-content)`, `--primary` → `var(--color-primary)`, …), Web and shadcn stay aligned without extra mapping.

**Note:** This skill uses the shadcn CLI and Figma MCP to draw components — it does not require manually importing a Figma community kit.

---

### /code-connect

Map Figma components to their codebase counterparts using Figma Code Connect.

**Syntax**
```
/code-connect
/code-connect <figma-file-key>
/code-connect https://www.figma.com/design/<file-key>/...
```

**Arguments**

| Argument | Description |
|---|---|
| `file_key` | Figma file URL or bare key. Falls back to `agent-handoff.md` context, then prompts interactively. |

**What it does**

1. Calls `get_design_context` to enumerate all `COMPONENT` and `COMPONENT_SET` nodes in the file
2. Calls `get_context_for_code_connect` on each component node to gather props and variants
3. Searches the local codebase for the matching source file for each component
4. Generates Code Connect mapping configurations and presents them for designer review
5. Publishes confirmed mappings via `send_code_connect_mappings`

**Important:** Claude will never publish Code Connect mappings without explicit designer confirmation.

**Note:** `get_code_connect_suggestions` is not used — it only surfaces components with pre-existing Code Connect metadata and returns empty for net-new components. `get_design_context` discovers all components regardless of prior Code Connect state.

**CLI fallback (Step 3b):** If the MCP path is unavailable, the skill automatically falls back to writing `.figma.tsx` files and publishing with `npx figma connect publish --token=<PAT>`. The PAT must have `code_connect:write` scope and is collected interactively — it is not needed up front.

---

### /new-language

Localize a Figma frame into a new language. Duplicates the frame to a new Figma page, extracts all text nodes, translates inline using Claude, and writes the translations back.

**Syntax**
```
/new-language
/new-language es
/new-language fr 123:456
```

**Arguments**

| Argument | Description |
|---|---|
| `locale` | BCP 47 locale code (e.g. `es`, `fr`, `de`, `ar`, `ja`). Prompted interactively with a reference table if omitted. |
| `node_id` | Figma node ID of the source frame (e.g. `123:456`). Prompted interactively if omitted. |

**What it does**

1. Duplicates the selected frame to a new Figma page named for the locale
2. Extracts all text node strings from the duplicated frame
3. Translates all strings inline using Claude — no external translation API required
4. Writes translated strings back to the cloned text nodes via Figma MCP

**RTL warning:** For right-to-left locales (`ar`, `fa`, `he`, `ur`), Claude displays a prominent warning that the layout needs to be mirrored manually.

---

### /accessibility-check

Run a WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility audit on a selected Figma frame, including contrast ratios, minimum text sizes, iOS Dynamic Type simulation, and Android font scaling simulation.

**Syntax**
```
/accessibility-check
/accessibility-check 123:456
```

**What it checks**

| Check | Standard | Threshold |
|---|---|---|
| Normal text contrast | WCAG 2.1 AA | 4.5:1 minimum |
| Large text contrast (≥24px regular or ≥18.67px bold) | WCAG 2.1 AA | 3:1 minimum |
| Minimum text size | WCAG 2.1 AA | 12px minimum recommended |
| iOS Dynamic Type simulation | Apple HIG — 12-step scale | Clones frame at all 12 multipliers (0.82× to 2.47×) |
| Android font scaling simulation | Material 3 / Android 14 | Clones frame at 100%, 130%, 150%, 200% |

**What it produces**

1. An inline pass/fail report in the Claude Code conversation
2. iOS Dynamic Type page — 12 frame clones arranged in 2 rows × 6 columns on a new Figma page
3. Android scaling page — 4 frame clones in a single row on a new Figma page
4. Optional report frame written to an `Accessibility` page in the Figma file

---

## Typical Workflow

A complete project setup from scratch through production-ready, code-connected components:

```
# 1. Scaffold the Foundations file in Figma (pages + doc UI + cover thumbnail)
/new-project --team "Client Team" --name "Acme App"

# 2. Push variables + tokens.css, then refresh style guide + MCP manifest + Token Overview + cover
/create-design-system

# 3. Install shadcn/ui components, wire tokens.css into globals.css,
#    and draw components onto the Figma canvas with token bindings
/create-component button input card dialog

# 4. Map Figma components to their codebase counterparts
/code-connect

# 5. Sync if tokens drift between code and Figma
/sync-design-system

# 6. Localize a screen
/new-language es 123:456

# 7. Run an accessibility audit before handoff
/accessibility-check 123:456
```

## Skill Chaining & Handoff Context

Skills pass context to each other through `templates/agent-handoff.md`. This file stores the active Figma file key, project name, CSS token file path, and last skill run so subsequent skills can pick up without re-prompting.

**Frontmatter fields:**

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `active_file_key` | The Figma file key currently being worked on |
| `active_project_name` | The project name as it appears in the Figma team space |
| `last_skill_run` | The last skill that was executed |
| `variable_slot_catalog_path` | Optional path to a variable slot catalog; usually empty unless your workflow uses one |
| `token_css_path` | Path to `tokens.css` written by `/create-design-system` — read by `/create-component` to wire the import into `globals.css` |
| `open_items` | Notes and unresolved items for the next skill to address |

**To pass context manually**, include the handoff file in your prompt:

```
/create-component button
Context: see templates/agent-handoff.md
```

Skills that accept a `file_key` argument always check `active_file_key` in the handoff first before prompting.

---

## Token Architecture

The design system uses a five-layer variable architecture in Figma with a matching CSS file in the codebase.

### Figma variable collections

```
Primitives  (Default mode)
  ├── color/primary/50–950    raw hex ramp
  ├── color/secondary/50–950  raw hex ramp
  ├── color/tertiary/50–950   raw hex ramp
  ├── color/error/50–950      raw hex ramp
  ├── color/neutral/50–950    raw hex ramp
  ├── Space/100–2400          px scale (4px base)
  ├── Corner/None–Full        px scale
  └── elevation/100–1600      unitless floats

Theme  (Light mode / Dark mode)
  ├── color/background/*      → app canvas + tonal layers (WEB `--color-background*`; ANDROID/iOS still M3 **surface** roles)
  ├── color/border/*          → outline / outlineVariant (`--color-border`, `--color-border-subtle`)
  ├── color/primary/*         → primary + primary fixed roles
  ├── color/secondary/*       → secondary + fixed roles
  ├── color/tertiary/*        → tertiary + fixed roles
  ├── color/status/*          → error + error fixed roles
  ├── color/component/*       → shadcn extensions (input, ring, sidebar)
  └── … 54 semantic tokens total (7 groups)

Typography  (8 scale modes: 85 · 100 · 110 · 120 · 130 · 150 · 175 · 200)
  ├── Display/LG–SM / font-family, font-size, font-weight, line-height
  ├── Headline/LG–SM / …
  ├── Body/LG–SM / …
  └── Label/LG–SM / …   (48 variables, sizes scale per mode)

Layout  (Default mode)
  ├── space/xs–4xl    → Space/* aliases
  └── radius/none–full → Corner/* aliases

Effects  (Light mode / Dark mode)
  ├── shadow/color       #000 @ 10% | #000 @ 30%
  └── shadow/sm–2xl/blur → elevation/* aliases
```

Every variable carries `codeSyntax` for all three platforms. There are no separate Web, Android/M3, or iOS/HIG alias collections — platform naming lives inline on each token.

**ANDROID (Theme)** uses [Material Design 3](https://m3.material.io/styles/color/static/baseline) **`ColorScheme` role names** (flat camelCase: `surface`, `surfaceContainerHigh`, `onSurface`, `outline`, `primaryFixed`, `errorFixed`, …) — the same identifiers as Jetpack Compose Material 3. Figma paths use **`color/background/*`** for the canvas layer group; ANDROID **`codeSyntax`** still says **`surface`** / **`onSurface`** (not `background`). **`component/*` tokens** map to shadcn extension names (`sidebar`, `ring`, …). See `/create-design-system` Step 6 for the full table. **iOS** uses **Apple HIG** system color names where a direct semantic equivalent exists.

`/create-design-system` supports **`--theme baseline`** (M3 baseline seed hues for Primitives ramps) or **`--theme brand`** / wizard defaults; see the skill for Step 2.5.

| Token | WEB | ANDROID (M3) | iOS (HIG) |
|---|---|---|---|
| `color/background/default` | `var(--color-background)` | `surface` | `systemBackground` |
| `color/background/container-high` | `var(--color-background-container-high)` | `surfaceContainerHigh` | `tertiarySystemGroupedBackground` |
| `color/background/variant` | `var(--color-background-variant)` | `surfaceVariant` | `tertiarySystemBackground` |
| `color/border/default` | `var(--color-border)` | `outline` | `separator` |
| `color/primary/tint` | `var(--color-primary-soft)` | `primaryContainer` | `primaryContainer` |
| `color/status/error` | `var(--color-danger)` | `error` | `systemRed` |
| `Headline/LG/font-size` | `var(--headline-lg-font-size)` | `headlineLgFontSize` | `headlineLgFontSize` |
| `space/md` | `var(--space-md)` | `spaceMd` | `spaceMd` |

### tokens.css — local codebase file

`/create-design-system` writes a `tokens.css` file (default path: `src/styles/tokens.css`) that mirrors the Figma variable structure as CSS custom properties:

```css
/* Primitives — raw values */
:root {
  --color-primary-500: #3b82f6;
  --space-400: 16px;
  --corner-medium: 12px;
}

/* Theme — Light (`--color-background*`, `--color-border*`, brand/status roles, shadcn aliases) */
:root, [data-theme="light"] {
  --color-background:                  var(--color-neutral-50);
  --color-background-container-highest: var(--color-neutral-50);
  --color-content:               var(--color-neutral-900);
  --color-border:                var(--color-neutral-200);
  --color-primary:               var(--color-primary-500);
  --color-on-primary:            var(--color-primary-50);
  --color-primary-soft:          var(--color-primary-100);
  --color-danger:                var(--color-error-600);
  --color-accent-soft:           var(--color-tertiary-100);
  /* …54 M3-aligned theme tokens as --color-* … */

  /* shadcn/ui compatibility aliases */
  --background:      var(--color-background);
  --foreground:      var(--color-content);
  --border:          var(--color-border);
  --destructive:     var(--color-danger);
  --accent:          var(--color-accent-soft);
  /* …aliases… */
}

/* Theme — Dark */
[data-theme="dark"],
@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) { :root:not([data-theme="light"]) { … } }

/* Typography — base scale */
:root {
  --headline-lg-font-size: 32px;
  --body-md-font-family: 'Inter', sans-serif;
  /* …48 properties… */
}

/* Typography — scale modes */
[data-font-scale="130"] { --headline-lg-font-size: 42px; … }
[data-font-scale="200"] { --headline-lg-font-size: 45px; … } /* nonlinear */

/* Layout */
:root { --space-md: var(--space-300); --radius-md: var(--corner-medium); }
```

**Primary CSS vars use M3 role names** (`--on-background`, `--outline`, `--primary-container`, `--error`, etc.). shadcn/ui compatibility aliases (`--foreground`, `--border`, `--destructive`, `--accent`, etc.) are defined as aliases pointing back to the M3 vars, so shadcn components resolve correctly with no additional mapping.

**Dark mode** is toggled by adding `data-theme="dark"` to the `<html>` element. **Font scaling** is toggled by adding `data-font-scale="130"` (or any of the 8 scale values) to `<html>`.

## Figma Project Structure

Detroit Labs projects use a standardized three-folder hierarchy within each Figma team:

```
<Team Name>
  └── Design-Systems/
        └── <Project Name> — Foundations
```

`/new-project` scaffolds the Foundations file only. The file is created in Drafts via the Figma MCP and moved into the Design-Systems/ folder manually using Figma's right-click → Move to Project UI.

1. Edit the corresponding `skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md` file — the instructions are plain Markdown, no compilation required
2. If adding a new skill, add an entry to `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` with the skill `name`, `description`, `path`, and `arguments` schema
3. Update `templates/workflow.md` and this `README.md` if the change affects designer-facing behavior or conventions
4. Test with a live Figma file using the Figma MCP connector before committing

All Figma operations require the Figma MCP connector to be active and authenticated with an Organization-tier account. The Variables REST API write endpoint (`PUT /v1/files/:key/variables`) is the most common source of plan-tier errors — verify your account tier if `/create-design-system` or `/sync-design-system` fails with a `403`.
